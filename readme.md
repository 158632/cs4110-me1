My reaction to reading Turing's work is that its interesting at the prospect of having another way of thinking how "thinking" machines would work. It presents various statements and arguments that he answers or explains; I find his explanations and answers to the nine objections interesting because its the first time I've seen them and his answers to them look solid. One of the more interesting thing I've seen Turing raise is that artificial intelligence is programmed with an adult mindset in mind. His proposal of instead of imitating the adult mind, it should imitate a child's mind is a fascinating take because it makes sense when thought about; since the paper is about making machine intelligence indistinguishably human, what better way to make it human-like than letting the machine "grow" and develop its own biases and attitudes? It also outlines that for machines to be human-like, it doesn't need our limbs or sensory organs, only that it learns like us. Apart from that, I'd give Turing credit because he tries to poignantly make his point by using simple examples of how machines ought to "think" and explaining in full what that meant so we have some examples. Honestly, even reading through it a few times, I'm still at a lost at some parts of the paper; its hard to follow sometimes because he uses 1940's Gentleman/Posh British English, so I think some of his statement are lost on me, or I derive a different meaning from what he intended.
